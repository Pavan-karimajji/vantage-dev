"""Evidence for the 2026-09-05 ``R-REQ-13``/``R-REQ-14`` change.

That change did four things to ``trace_check.py``: it deleted the document
length cap, demoted the requirement budget from a failure to a reported
expectation, added the commentary cap that replaced both, and started printing
``budget_history``. A fifth is an unrelated bug fix -- a declared-but-unwritten
test spec used to raise instead of reporting.

**The commentary cap itself is proved by the module's own ``--selftest``**
(``selftest_mutations.yaml``, the mechanism ``R-REQ-9`` already sanctions).
What that mechanism cannot express is the *absence* of a finding, which is
most of what this change is -- so this file covers the negative half:

======================================  ====================================
claim                                   why --selftest cannot prove it
======================================  ====================================
document length is no longer capped     nothing to plant; the check is gone
over budget is a note, not a finding    a plant asserts a finding APPEARS
commentary is reported in --stats       output, not a finding
budget_history is printed               output, not a finding
missing test spec never raises          a traceback is not a finding
======================================  ====================================

Run:  python py/test_checker_additions.py           # the checks
      python py/test_checker_additions.py --plant   # prove they can fail
